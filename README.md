## Development

This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as the build system. To install Maven on macOS run:

```sh
brew install mvn
```

To compile, build, and test the project run:

```
mvn verify
```

### Maven Phases

Each of the following Maven commands would be run as `mvn <PHASE>` (e.g. `mvn validate`, from *[Introduction to the Build Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html)*):

- `validate` - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- `compile` - compile the source code of the project
- `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- `verify` - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
- `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
